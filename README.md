This project explores the application of Ridge and Lasso regression techniques in predicting college graduation rates using the College dataset, comprising various attributes of colleges across the United States. Ridge regression introduces a penalty term proportional to the square of coefficients, while Lasso regression utilizes a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of coefficients. The study aims to compare the predictive performance and feature selection capabilities of these regularization techniques. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, both regression models were assessed based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a test dataset. Results indicate that while Ridge regression slightly outperformed Lasso regression in terms of predictive accuracy, Lasso regression offered a more interpretable model by performing feature selection. Insights from coefficient analysis revealed nuanced differences in variable importance between the two techniques. The findings provide valuable guidance for choosing between Ridge and Lasso regression based on specific analytical needs, such as predictive accuracy, interpretability, and feature selection.
